# Let's Talk Random Chat <img src="https://i.ibb.co/DrX8MHj/speech-bubble.png" height="40">

Let's talk is a chat to find new friends:
- Choose your nickname (please, just **do not** be offensive)
- Choose your country (now it is possible to choose between two, in the future there are plans to add new countries with e.g. voivodeships)
- Start chatting!

Now you will be paired with a stranger from the same *category* - country.
Enjoy chatting!

**It's never too late to find a new friend.**
